When it comes to deep learning-based object detection there are three primary object detection methods that you’ll likely encounter:

Faster R-CNNs (Ren et al., 2015)
You Only Look Once (YOLO) (Redmon et al., 2015)
Single Shot Detectors (SSDs) (Liu et al., 2015)
Faster R-CNNs are likely the most “heard of” method for object detection using deep learning; however, the technique can be difficult to understand (especially for beginners in deep learning), hard to implement, and challenging to train.

Furthermore, even with the “faster” implementation R-CNNs (where the “R” stands for “Region Proposal”) the algorithm can be quite slow, on the order of 7 FPS.

If we are looking for pure speed then we tend to use YOLO as this algorithm is much faster, capable of processing 40-90 FPS on a Titan X GPU. The super fast variant of YOLO can even get up to 155 FPS.

The problem with YOLO is that it leaves much accuracy to be desired.

SSDs, originally developed by Google, are a balance between the two. The algorithm is more straightforward (and I would argue better explained in the original seminal paper) than Faster R-CNNs.

We can also enjoy a much faster FPS throughput than Ren et al. at 22-46 FPS depending on which variant of the network we use. SSDs also tend to be more accurate than YOLO. To learn more about SSDs, please refer to Liu et al.
